# TWEB Lab 2 - Interactive Polls

## Introduction

In this lab, we are asked to present everything we will implement in our `Interactive Polls` project. The final project will allow speakers to interact with an audience by asking questions that the auditors can answer to. While the audience send their answers, the speaker who asked the question can see real time statistics about the answers.

There is the list of main features asked for friday december 9th:

- This README file with:
	- A list of people working on this project.
	- Techs and frameworks used in this project.
	- Instructions to run the project in a local environment (with the prerequisites).
	- Mockups of the final UI (with screen transitions).
	- A link to the <del>past</del> landing page.
- No commit from any dependancy.
- No hard config in the code.
- A landing page that:
	- Anyone can access from the web.
	- Must use a nice HTML template.
	- Must be written for the end user of the project, as for a real project and not a lab.
	- Must describe the project as it will be in its final state.
	- Must contain images of the interface (muckups are allowed if the final interface is not yet ready).
