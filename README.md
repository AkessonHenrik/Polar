# Polar
Polar is a project in (very early) development that will allow speakers and audiences to interact using polls.

A speaker will be able to ask questions, and see in real time what their audience answers.

For more information, visit https://akessonhenrik.github.io/Polar/ and feel free to come back later to use the project in action!
